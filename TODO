Questions:

Define private resource scheme outside the network?

Miner incentives, coin generation from nothing?

Why do we need to verify duplicated transactions, is the block sequence number not enough?

Proof of ? extra points

InvokeAsync thread synchronization wait for reply listener

Data structure for validating transactions. Chains or Dictionary Options: List<List<Trx>> or Map<Wallet,Trx>

Benchmarking scenarios and metrics




Remember:

Transactions must included the client signature (while preserving anonymity)

Miner reward resource is named:  coinbase resource

When building a block the validation of an account balance must take into account the previous transactions inside the block

Transaction nonce are increased on reception, the server detects duplicated transactions using the nonce and warns the user



Backlog:

Client Id provenance is random seed not the client email

Nonce is an int equal to number of transactions performed by the client, start session is still required, the client persist the last nonce

Generate proper signature keys

Fix the lastEntry mechanism

Findout why arent meesages from replicas being signed
